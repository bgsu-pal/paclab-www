OVERVIEW:

**main.MainTransform.java** 
Given a directory of Java projects, this program attempts to transform each .java file in the directory into a compilable benchmark.
 
A directory of benchmarks is created, containing the programs that would successfully compile (before or after transformation) in their original directory structure. 

**mainFullFramework.MainAnalysis.java**
Given a CSV of GitHub repositories (as gathered by RepoReaper), this program will select suitable repositories, download them, search or classes containing SPF-suitable methods, and transform suitable classes into compilable, benchmark programs. The resulting benchmarks are run with Java PathFinder.
