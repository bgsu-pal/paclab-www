/* RunLengthEncoding.java */

/**
 *  The RunLengthEncoding class defines an object that run-length encodes
 *  a PixImage object.  Descriptions of the methods you must implement appear
 *  below.  They include constructors of the form
 *
 *      public RunLengthEncoding(int width, int height);
 *      public RunLengthEncoding(int width, int height, int[] red, int[] green,
 *                               int[] blue, int[] runLengths) {
 *      public RunLengthEncoding(PixImage image) {
 *
 *  that create a run-length encoding of a PixImage having the specified width
 *  and height.
 *
 *  The first constructor creates a run-length encoding of a PixImage in which
 *  every pixel is black.  The second constructor creates a run-length encoding
 *  for which the runs are provided as parameters.  The third constructor
 *  converts a PixImage object into a run-length encoding of that image.
 *
 *  See the README file accompanying this project for additional details.
